    """Divergence: a stored alert with no severity is dropped by an
    info severity floor, instead of being read as severity info.

    (a) Doc claim (docs/senses.md, "Alert format", line 293):
        "`severity`: critical/high/medium/low/info. Missing defaults
        to info."
        The same section's profile defaults give `severity_floor` a
        "Default info (keep all)", and the "senses" query op reads
        stored alerts back through load_alerts(severity_floor=...).

    (b) How the bug was found: the campaign's doc-default hunt
        (2026-10-22 22:51 PDT tick) exercised runner/senses.py with
        the severity key omitted and varied -- omitted key, explicit
        None, the ingest gate, and the score function -- then stored
        a severity-less record with the module's own store_alert and
        read it back with load_alerts(severity_floor="info"), the
        read path the senses query op uses.

    (c) Behavior actually observed: validate_sensor_alert, gate_alert
        and alert_score all honor the documented default (a missing
        severity is accepted, kept at the info floor, and scored 0.5,
        the info score). load_alerts does not: its floor filter uses
        SEVERITY_SCORES.get(rec.get("severity"), 0), so a record with
        no severity scores 0 -- below info's 0.5 -- and
        load_alerts(severity_floor="info") silently drops a record
        that every other path in the same module treats as an info
        alert. Observed on 2026-10-22: of three stored records
        (severity omitted, "info", "low"), the floor="info" read-back
        returned only the latter two.

    (d) Do not make this test pass by editing the test. It passes
        only when the bug described above is fixed in the code.
