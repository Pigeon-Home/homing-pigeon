# Changelog

## 3.7.6 — 2026-10-16

### Oracle chat
- The Oracle page now opens with a pre-filled prompt ("Give me a summary of
  the job status of what you found on this system.") and a short statement
  of the Oracle's role: what it watches, what it can read and run, and that
  nothing leaves the machine.
- Fixed the agent loop leaking raw tool calls into the chat. Small local
  models (llama3.2:3b via Ollama) often emit `{"name": ..., "parameters":
  {...}}` as message text instead of native `tool_calls`; the parser only
  recognized the native shape, so the JSON blob was shown as the "answer"
  instead of executing. Content-embedded calls are now detected (fenced or
  bare), restricted to the known Oracle tool names; native `tool_calls`
  still take precedence.
- The Oracle's system prompt now defines Homing Pigeon vocabulary (what a
  "job" is, retained job files, the runner log) and names this box's real
  state directory, retained folder, and log path, so "job status" questions
  resolve to files instead of guesses. Tool commands run with the state
  directory as the working directory, and relative tool paths resolve
  against it.

### Verification
- Unit tests in `tests/test_oracle_chat.py` capture the learnings:
  content-embedded tool calls (bare and fenced), unknown names staying
  plain text, native calls winning over content, pre-filled page prompt,
  role section, state paths in the system prompt, relative path
  resolution, and the tool working directory.
- End-to-end: release one-liner on the deployment box, Oracle chat
  against the local model answering the pre-filled job-status summary.
